  # similiar and size score requirements for determining if a file is out of sync.
  # for similar scores, the closer to 1.0 the value is, the more a file must match with 1.0 being an exact match.
  # for size scores, the value is the percent difference in terms of file size, so the closer to 0 the value is,
  # the more a file must match.
  #
  # these scores are used together because a file can be considered fairly similar but still be out of sync.  for example, if
  # a few lines were added to the skeleton .gitignore, a package's gitignore might be considered similar but would be listed as
  # out of sync due to the size difference.
